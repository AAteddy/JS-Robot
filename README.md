# JS-Robot
A pure JavaScript, CSS (BootStrap) &amp; HTML project with JS DOM manipulation implementation.
All right, so are you a robot or not, and this project is going to determine that, 
and for that we're going to create a small application and we also also are only going to use basic.
We will implement event listeners & arrays a bit.
And what we can also do with arrays like temporaries, a real method, which is a foreach loop.
We're going to work with a little bit with conditionals, simple else, if else statement, 
then we're going to use also the math project.
We're going to use the Doppler and random.
Then some booleans which impose string and numbers functions only the regular function.
And we're also going to take on the class list and we're going to add and remove from class lists.
